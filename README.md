Seven Square
============

Android screencast wroted in QT. There is one in java? forget it from now on.

A tool used to view a mirror screen of your Android device on the PC,
used for demostration, debuging, and so on. even you can click on the
mirror screen as you touch on the device panel.

+ Tested host: Linux, Windows.
+ Tested device: QRD8x25/8x26, Linaro Panda board (OMAP4430), TCL Idol X (MTK6589)
+ Tested Android: 4.0, 4.1, 4.2

Features
--------

Major:

 * Click and swipe on the screen (so you can unlock screen by swipe)
 * Virtual menu/home/back key on the UI
 * QWERTY key support (just type via your keyboard)
 * Auto connect to your device when plug in
 * Click on window to wakeup the device (emulate power key press event)
 * Support both Android ICS and Jelly Bean. Froyo not full tested
 * Wrote in Qt 4.x, easily port to different desktop environment

Minor:

 * Rotate view windows on demand (Press F12)
 * Virtual cursor (pointer anchor) on the UI
 * Auto resize to fit the screen resolution of the device
 * Zoom window as your wish and keep the ratio
 * Support customized 'screencap' for speeding up (RGBA32, RGB888, RGB565)
 * Auto enable compressed data transfer if 'minigzip' found on the host
 * 1~2FPS on MSM8625 device (1.2G dual core, 512M memory, 800x480)

Non-feature:

 * Not support multi devices pluged in at the same time.
 * Not support screen recording as video
 * Not support screen shot as picture

Additional Key Map
==================

You can press F1/2/3/4 on you keyboard to emulate the following Android key.

 * For device:

        F1 AKEYCODE_HOME
        F2 AKEYCODE_BACK
        F3 AKEYCODE_CALL
        F4 AKEYCODE_ENDCALL

 * For application on PC:

        F12 Rotate view window (Landscape/Portrait)

Pre-requirements
================

Mandatory
---------

 * Linux, any distribution with Qt package.

 * Qt 4.x+ installed in your system

 * screencap command on the target device

        $> adb shell ls /system/bin/screencap
        /system/bin/screencap

   If the output indicates: 'No such file or direcotry', you
   can use the tool except install one by yourself.

   the 'screencap' source code presents in frameworks/base/cmds/screencap.

 * PC: adb command is availible in your search path, check it:

        $> which adb
        /usr/bin/adb

 * USB cable connected to your android device

Optional
--------

 * Android device in engineer mode (Rooted), So that you can get
   root permission in adb shell

        $> adb root
        $> adb shell id
        uid=0(root) gid=0(root)

 * minigzip installed on your PC (For compressed image transfer)
  
     There is a precompiled x86_64 minigzip binary in the contirbutes dir,
     just copy into your system path:

        $> sudo cp contributes/minigzip /usr/bin

     If you want to compile one for yourself, get it from android/external/zlib:

        $> cp -rf android/external/zlib zlib-pc
        $> cd zlib-pc
        $> ./configure
        $> make
        $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

     You'll be appreciated If you can help to add decompress code in to this
     project to help to avoid runing external program 'minizip' to decompress frame buffer data.

 * Reduce screen data size generated by screencap

     Currently, we use 'screencap' command on device to capture the screen
     content, bigger screen solution got more data to transfer between device
     and Host which cause more lag.

     I've added tow options to the screencap which haven't adopted by
     upstream yet, you can apply this patch to your source code to reduce the data
     size generated by screencap to reduce the transfer lag.

        $> cd frameworks/base/cmds/screencap
        $> patch -p3 < $PATH_TO_SEVENSQAURE/contributes/0001-Add-option-q-s-for-screencap-L/M/N.patch
        $> mm
        $> # Push new screencap to your device

    Original screencap output image in RGBA_8888 format, we add option to
    convert it into RGB888/RGB565 to save transfer and compress time, which already
    supported by current seven-square.

    New options:

       -q: quality prefered, will convert to RGB888. - 25% size reduced.
       -s: speed prefered, will convert to RGB565.   - 50% size reduced.

Compile
=======

Install dependences and just make:

    $> apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqtcore4 libqtgui4
    $> make

Run from source tree:

    $> ./build/seven-square

Install into system wide:

    $> make install

Or you can create a short cut on your desktop.

Keypad support
==============

 If you want support more key define in the UI, please read
 the contributes/generate-keymap.sh for more info.

FAQ
===

 Q: Can I connect to my device via network and using seven-sqaure?
 A: Yes, just use 'adb connect ...' to connect your device before
    running seven-sqaure, make sure you can see it via 'adb devices',
    and you can run 'adb shell ls'

 Q: I noticed a log of lag, can that be fixed?
 A: Try to follow the guideline in the 'Optional' section, which
    will help a bit on this issue.

History
=======

'Seven Square' was a game I played when I was a child, and I wrote a QT version
for it, in the branch sevensquare-game, [screenshot]:(screenshots/Screenshot-sq.png).
And now it's the base code of this tool.
